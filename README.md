# FinTech Case Study - SheeldMarket

## Overview and Origin

* __*Name of company*__  
 
 **SheeldMarkets SAS**

* __*When was the company incorporated?*__  
  
**October 16th 2019**

* __*Who are the founders of the company?*__  
 
 The company was funded by three young French engineers who have been extremely active in crypto/blockchain world for several years now. Their name are **Oliver Yates**, **Arnaud Carrere** and **Simon Douyer**.


* __*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*__  
 
 The idea came from the gap that existed in the cryptocurrency industry to bring professional trading tools and infrastructures into the digital world. The mission was/is to support and foster the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market.


* __*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*__  
 
 In June 29th 2020, the company completed a “seed funding” round of €1 million with 10 investors including: Axeleo Capital, Draper Dragon, Kima Ventures, Acequia Capital and Angel investor Charlie Songhurst.



## Business Activities

* __*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*__  
 
 SheeldMarkets tries to tackle three key roadblocks faced by institutional investors:  

i. Aggregation of exchanges: The Cryptocurrency market is extremely fragmented with over 50 CeFi (Centralized Finance) exchanges. Being able to connect AND trade on most of them brings up a significant operational challenge. SheelMarkets solved the issue by replicating the existing “Prime Broker” model currently used in traditional finance. Beyond the connectivity work, the key challenge is to keep enough fiat/coins in each exchange to allow clients to benefit from the aggregation of executable prices. 
    
ii. Execution: Algorithmic execution with smart order routing systems are extremely important in a fragmented and OTC(Over The Counter) market. SheeldMarkets brings a highly sophisticated set of execution algos, again bringing over into the crypto world the knowledge and mechanisms used in equities and FX(Foreign Exchange) markets. The goal is to meet the institutional investors expectation in terms of best execution practices. The company also created its own “Dark Pool” in order to match clients’ orders while avoiding leakage of information. 
    
iii. Regulation: Currently the market is still widely unregulated which is preventing a whole segment of institutional investors (any regulated entities like pension funds) from entering the space. Being registered and regulated by the AMF (French Market Authority), SheeldMarkets tackle this regulatory issue by being approved to operate across Europe.  


* __*Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*__  
  
SheeldMarkets targets professionals/institutions investors, these could be Traders,Hedge Funds, CTAs,Miners,Pension Funds…  
Unfair Advantage:    

    - First crypto Prime Broker model being approved and regulated in Europe    
    - Quality of their Algorithmic execution offer (Including their Dark Pool)


* __*Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*__

## Landscape

* __*What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*__    

**Cryptocurrencies**


* __*What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years*__    

Institutionalization of the market, providing the know-how and infrastructure necessary to meet institutional investors expectation - requirements.

* __*What are the other major companies in this domain?*__  

SheelMarket is in a niche, they only have 3 serious competitors which actually started before them :    

    - SFOX
    - FalconX
    - Tagomi (recently acquired by Coinbase)    
  
There are also few Dex (decentralized exchanges) that are looking to aggregate CeFi(centralized Finance) and DeFi(Decentralized Finance)and SWAP pools like FinFXFlo or Orian Protocal. However, none of those names solve the operational issue of keeping accounts in each of the CeFi platforms. They provide only the connectivity pieces.



## Results

* __*What has been the business impact of this company so far?*__   

SheeldMarkets position itself as a contender to FalconX or Tagomi who launched their offer few years prior. It is too early to say whether the company will be successful but they are providing a solution to the industry to foster institutional adoption. Hence the potential is there, now they need to succeed in marketing it.   


* __*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*__ 
  
Client adoptions and Volumes executed through their network.


* __*How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*__  

They are early stage but they are the first one being registered in Europe. It will be hard for them to compete in the US but they are well positioned to conquer Europe market. 



## Recommendations

* __*If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*__ 

I will suggest them to open an OTC desk (= voice desk) to manage large orders and provide high touch coverage to their clients. This is critical and often required for some of the large institutions (given the size of their orders, some large names would rather transfer the risk of the execution to a tradition voice sales coverage).


* __*What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*__ 

N/A (Voice Trading Service)

* __*Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*__
